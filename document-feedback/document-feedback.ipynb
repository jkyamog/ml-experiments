    "# The Challenge\n",
    "Tackling an interesting problem: given a user query, search through a PDF document and provide feedback on how well the query aligns with the document's content.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Solution\n",
    "The approach is a three-step process: Load & Index, Search & RAG, and Feedback Generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load & Index\n",
    "First, I need to understand the PDF document. I do this by creating a \"semantic index\". It's like creating a map of the document, but instead of landmarks, we have vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Search & RAG\n",
    "Next, I take your query and find the most related parts in the PDF document. This is where RAG (Retrieval Augmentation Generation) comes in. It's like giving the system a cheat sheet before the big test.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feedback Generation\n",
    "Finally, I generate feedback for you. This isn't just a simple \"yes\" or \"no\". I provide detailed feedback with references from the PDF document. It's like having footnotes for your query.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Caveats and Considerations\n",
    "- **AI and LLMs are still evolving**. Theyâ€™re like teenagers - unpredictable and constantly changing. So, sometimes, they might give you surprising outputs.\n",
    "- **Quality of feedback** depends on your query. Too short or too vague, and you might not get accurate feedback. Too long or complex, and you might confuse the system. For optimal results, aim for the Goldilocks zone - a few sentences to about 1 paragraph. Not too short, not too long.\n",
    "- **Feedback may be slow**. It might take a few seconds before the LLM responds.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dive Deeper\n",
    "The code is open for you to explore. Feel free to fork it, and see how it fits your use case. I'll break down each section and highlight key points.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any suggestions or improvements, don't hesitate to share. For more technical details, continue reading along this Jupyter notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I started to develop this with a Jupiter Notebook, then implemented into fastapi backend and sveltekit frontend.  I then re-organized and rewritten the Jupiter notebook to distill and explain the different essential parts.  I also changed the implementation from AzureOpenAI to OpenAI, AzureSearch to Chroma.  Langchain's wrappers around them make it easy swap the implementations."
